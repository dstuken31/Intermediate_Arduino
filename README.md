### Description 

In LED Blink Revisited we made a LED fade in and out instead of just turning on and off.  We had to learn to use Analog Write instead of Digital Write to get the LED to fade.  We also had to have a serial monitor correspond with the LED.  

### Lessons Learned

The biggest struggle completing this assignment was not remembering anything from last year.  After looking at some of my old code and the CHS Wiki page I was able to complete the assignment. 

* How to Use Analog Write* and For Loops**

### Notes

* Analog Write https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogwrite/
* For Loops https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/for/

### Description 

In Hello LCD we used an LCD screen to print "Hello World" and print the number of seconds the code was active. 

### What I Learned

* The Basics of the LCD Screen*
* The Liquid Crystal Library**

### Description 

In LCD Backpack we had the LCD Print the number of times the button was pushed.

### What I Learned 
* How to use the LCD Backpack* Instead of connecting all 16 pins 
* How to use If Loops**
